# cpp-fundamentals
This repository was built with the intention of reinforcing core C++ language fundamentals before I move on to more complex topics such as concurrency, networking, and performance-critical systems.

It contains a collection of small, focused programs that isolate individual C++ concepts and explore their behaviour in a clear and explicit way. The emphasis is on understanding the language’s value model, memory model, object lifetime, and ownership rules rather than on building end-user features or abstractions.

The examples are intentionally minimal to avoid hiding important details. Some files include commented-out or disabled code that would not compile; these sections are deliberately included to document common mistakes, undefined behaviour, or incorrect usage patterns.

This repository is intended as a reinforcement and reference tool, not as a complete C++ tutorial or production codebase. It exists to ensure that fundamental concepts are well understood and internalised before progressing to advanced areas of C++ development.

Most examples are self-contained and can be compiled directly with a C++17-compatible compiler.
